# The C Programming Language - Exercices

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises from _"The C Programming Language"_ by Kernighan and Ritchie.

## Objective

I'm documenting my learning process as I study the C Language through the K&R book. And in the process, I also want to learn git and GitHub practices.

## 📁 Project Structure

Every exercice are inside "src" directory, following a simple strcture:

src/
chapter01/
| ex_1_1.c
| ex_1_2.c
| ...

chapter02/
| ex_2_1.c
| ex_2_2.c
| ...

...

## 🛠 Tools & Setup

**Editor**: Visual Studio Code
**Compiler**: MinGW (via MSYS2)
**Build System**: CMake
**C Standard**: C89

I've chosen to use the C89, and maybe it's weird but i want to get familiarized with low-level C programming.

Other build and configurations details can be found in my "CMakeLists.txt" file.

## 📝 Notes

This is part of my learning journey. I'm open to suggestions, feedback, or code reviews—feel free to share anything that helps me improve.
